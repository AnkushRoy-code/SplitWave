# SplitWave
My very own custom wireless ergonomic split keyboard.

Splitwave is a 44 key column-staggered split keyboard that uses Choc switches.
Is is powered by SuperMini nRF52840 micro-controller. It is created during the
[Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com/) event of [Hackclub](https://hackclub.com/). The whole process of making it is journaled [here](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/JOURNAL.md).

One day my work keyboard stopped working and I always dreamed of having those
fancy split keyboards but I was never lucky to have one at that same period of
time. HackClub announced Highway event, and I hopped into it!! The timing
couldn't have been any more perfect!!!

## PCBs
SplitWave has a reversible PCB(which means you can order one PCB in stack and
use that for both left and right).
The KiCAD PCB file is located [here](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/ergogen/pcb/board.kicad_pcb).
