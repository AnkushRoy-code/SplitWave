# Total Time: 5Hrs

## 25th May 2025 - Research

I went on over many videos on how to make a keyboard. One such video that I
will be taking inspiration from is [this](https://youtu.be/7UXsD7nSfDY?si=TfY8_UKlWWHZYKqw).

I tried to make a list of things I will need and their price, I also looked at
different options for the items I will use, for example I desperately read
stuff about Pro Micro because that is cheaper than n!n but I came to conclusion
that Pro Micro will be a little hard for what I am lookign to achieve, I still
may change my opinion later down the line. Most of the prices are from
[Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz).
Another website I found good is [Meckeys](https://meckeys.com).

I looked at different types of switch options I have and its hard to decide
now. I will take my time now. The price on the rough BOM rn is the one present
in Typeractive. If I don't find anything cheaper or really worth it I won't
change it. I also looked at the keycaps for a long time but I think I won't
need anything other than what Typeractive offers.

I have not started any real work now.

But I do have the starting foundation layed out.
I now have a clear vision in mind now for what to do next. (Board design using
ErgoGen ig)

The rough BOM: https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/StuffNeeded.md

#### Rough Sketch
10:00PM I drew a rough sketch of how it should look like... the alignment and
staggerdness is not what I want. It is just a place holder also it will be
Colemak_mod_dh layout instead of qwerty. I just had a keyboard with qwerty keys
infornt of me so I used that as a reference.

| Color          | Layer           |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Red            | Default         |
| Green          | Number          |
| Black          | Function        |

All the keys are subjected to change

Here's a picture of what it should look like (again not the final thing. Only
the structure)

**Total Time Taken: 5hrs**

The sketch took ~2hrs, took a lot of planning!
