# Total Time: 12Hrs

## 25th May 2025 - Research

I went on over many videos on how to make a keyboard. One such video that I
will be taking inspiration from is [this](https://youtu.be/7UXsD7nSfDY?si=TfY8_UKlWWHZYKqw).

I tried to make a list of things I will need and their price, I also looked at
different options for the items I will use, for example I desperately read
stuff about Pro Micro because that is cheaper than n!n but I came to conclusion
that Pro Micro will be a little hard for what I am lookign to achieve, I still
may change my opinion later down the line. Most of the prices are from
[Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz).
Another website I found good is [Meckeys](https://meckeys.com).

I looked at different types of switch options I have and its hard to decide
now. I will take my time now. The price on the rough BOM rn is the one present
in Typeractive. If I don't find anything cheaper or really worth it I won't
change it. I also looked at the keycaps for a long time but I think I won't
need anything other than what Typeractive offers.

I have not started any real work now.

But I do have the starting foundation layed out.
I now have a clear vision in mind now for what to do next. (Board design using
ErgoGen ig)

The rough BOM: https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/StuffNeeded.md

#### Rough Sketch
10:00PM I drew a rough sketch of how it should look like... the alignment and
staggerdness is not what I want. It is just a place holder also it will be
Colemak_mod_dh layout instead of qwerty. I just had a keyboard with qwerty keys
infornt of me so I used that as a reference.

| Color          | Layer           |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Red            | Default         |
| Green          | Number          |
| Black          | Function        |

All the keys are subjected to change

Here's a picture of what it should look like (again not the final thing. Only the structure)

**Total Time Taken: 5hrs**

The sketch took ~2hrs, took a lot of planning!

## 26th May 2025 - More Research On ErgoGen

**Evening**
Watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tERUZ_BSPM) 20min video by the creator of Ergogen.
Read the entire [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz/) of Ergogen.
I will not bore anyone with the things I learnt here. Also there was a lot to
digest so I might've forgotten a lot of stuff by the end...ðŸ˜¢

**Night**
Another [tutorial](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-part1-units-points/) mentioned in the docs seemed really helpful to me. During my
journey I'll I will use it too!

*Total Time Till Now: 7hrs*

## 27th May 2025 - Getting the Keyboard to life

Sat down and wrote the config for my keyboard, it is taking shape now. But
there is a lot that I have to change and tiker.

Took longer than I thought, the flatfootfox tutorial is very good! I learnt the
same things better I'd say. I decided to let go of the 5th key in the thumb
cluster. I only have 4 keys now. I am done with the structure that I seem fit
for my usecase.

Up until now it approx took **1.5hrs** in total.

Now I am done with the outline too! Took **1hrs** at the very least.

The config.yaml can be found [here](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/ergogen/config.yaml).

Did even more study on mcu(s) to use. Asked some pros in ergogen discord and
they answered immideatly.
The things I am considering now:

    - Not nice!nano anymore $25
    - Seeed XIAO nRF52840 $10.5
    - SuperMini nRF52840 $9.5

I have read about a lot on the mcus I decided that I will be using Seeed XIAO
because of the pros suggestion and SuperMini being russian roullete. That is a
saving of a whooping $25!!

The only problem is that I there's not much resources as n!n in the web. But I
will make it work out!

Apart from that I also read the ZMK docs, the Seeed XIAO nRF52840 docs and the
next day my target will be completing the research of the mcu and be done with
the pcb
