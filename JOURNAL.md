# Total Time: 69Hrs

## 25th May 2025 - Research

I went on over many videos on how to make a keyboard. One such video that I
will be taking inspiration from is [this](https://youtu.be/7UXsD7nSfDY?si=TfY8_UKlWWHZYKqw).

I tried to make a list of things I will need and their price, I also looked at
different options for the items I will use, for example I desperately read
stuff about Pro Micro because that is cheaper than n!n but I came to conclusion
that Pro Micro will be a little hard for what I am lookign to achieve, I still
may change my opinion later down the line. Most of the prices are from
[Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz).
Another website I found good is [Meckeys](https://meckeys.com).

I looked at different types of switch options I have and its hard to decide
now. I will take my time now. The price on the rough BOM rn is the one present
in Typeractive. If I don't find anything cheaper or really worth it I won't
change it. I also looked at the keycaps for a long time but I think I won't
need anything other than what Typeractive offers.

I have not started any real work now.

But I do have the starting foundation layed out.
I now have a clear vision in mind now for what to do next. (Board design using
ErgoGen ig)

The rough BOM: https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/StuffNeeded.md

#### Rough Sketch
10:00PM I drew a rough sketch of how it should look like... the alignment and
staggerdness is not what I want. It is just a place holder also it will be
Colemak_mod_dh layout instead of qwerty. I just had a keyboard with qwerty keys
infornt of me so I used that as a reference.

| Color          | Layer           |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Red            | Default         |
| Green          | Number          |
| Black          | Function        |

All the keys are subjected to change

Here's a picture of what it should look like (again not the final thing. Only the structure)

**Total Time Taken: 5hrs**

The sketch took ~2hrs, took a lot of planning!

## 26th May 2025 - More Research On ErgoGen

**Evening**
Watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tERUZ_BSPM) 20min video by the creator of Ergogen.
Read the entire [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz/) of Ergogen.
I will not bore anyone with the things I learnt here. Also there was a lot to
digest so I might've forgotten a lot of stuff by the end...😢

**Night**
Another [tutorial](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-part1-units-points/) mentioned in the docs seemed really helpful to me. During my
journey I'll I will use it too!

**Total Time Taken: 2hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 7hrs*

## 27th May 2025 - Getting the Keyboard to life

Sat down and wrote the config for my keyboard, it is taking shape now. But
there is a lot that I have to change and tiker.

Took longer than I thought, the flatfootfox tutorial is very good! I learnt the
same things better I'd say. I decided to let go of the 5th key in the thumb
cluster. I only have 4 keys now. I am done with the structure that I seem fit
for my usecase.

Up until now it approx took **1.5hrs** in total.

Now I am done with the outline too! Took **1hrs** at the very least.

<p align="center">

  <b>An image of the keyboard with outline generated by ErgoGen</b>
</p>

The config.yaml can be found [here](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/ergogen/config.yaml).

Did even more study on mcu(s) to use. Asked some pros in ergogen discord and
they answered immideatly.
The things I am considering now:
- Not nice!nano anymore `$25`
- Seeed XIAO nRF52840 `$10.5`
- SuperMini nRF52840 `$9.5`

I have read about a lot on the mcus I decided that I will be using Seeed XIAO
because of the pros suggestion and SuperMini being russian roullete. That is a
saving of a whooping $25!!

The only problem is that I there's not much resources as n!n in the web. But I
will make it work out!

Apart from that I also read the ZMK docs, the Seeed XIAO nRF52840 docs and the
next day my target will be completing the research of the mcu and be done with
the pcb

**Total Time Taken: 5hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 12hrs*

## 28th May 2025 - Shopping

Searched other Indian stores a lot, a frind suggested me this reddit [wiki](www.reddit.com/r/mkindia/wiki/vendors/)
that had good Indian vendors. I found NeoMarco to be my choice of vendor. Had
all the stuff I needed, all of them cheaper than typeractive, has free
shipping, is trusted too!

But I had some compatibility confusions so I dropped them an email. I hope they answer soon.

And the downsides now. I planned to have 3 things from typeractive
- Switches
- Keycaps
- Hot Swap

and all these 3 had great quality and were to my liking. But in NeoMarco the
problems are:

- Switches: Only Yellow is in stock. I wanted Red (The colours matter for
typing experience if you didn't know. Each colour has different feel to them).
But I am ready to compromise
- Keycaps: Only Transparent is available. I don't mind it that much. I think
trans is cool!
- Hot Swap: Looks weird. Had compatibility doubts so I dropped an email.

Overall I think all the stores are great. Just that they can't do everything
for everyone. typeractive would've been my go-to if I were in the west.

*This took like a little more than an hour*

Spent a lot of time searching for batteries. Took a long time but finally found
it! In quartzcomponents' website.

Also I am half done with my pcb!

**Total Time Taken: 3hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 15hrs*

## 29th May 2025 - BOM.csv, MCU selection

Today my plans are of making the BOM in a csv file with links. Since it's
getting hard to manage everything rn.

The Bom is done hardly took 30mins.

New problem! QuartzComponents doesn't support hcb 😭😭 I will have to again
search for batterise.

Found some batteries [here](https://makerbazar.in/products/3-7v-2200mah-li-po-rechargeable-battery) no I idea if it supports hcb but I will have it
here just for backup.

A very bad news. The footprint I was using for seeed_xiao was for seeed xiao.
Not seeed xiao plus. But the bigger problem is the battery connection. It is a
mess in xiao.

Unfortunately because of the battery problem I have to drop XIAO. I will be
using Nice!Nano.

I am really sad....I have made good progress towards making the pcb, but the
price is concerning. I have to do something about it. I know it. I will just
not use Nice!Nano. I will just use the off-brand mcus. Even though they are
really sketchy. I will have to trust them. Or else I will be wasting a lot of
money because I was scared of Seeed XIAO, the one I am looking at right now is
this: [supermini](https://robokits.co.in/iot-wireless-solutions/iot-internet-of-things/iot-esp-module/supermini-nrf52840-pro-micro-bluetooth-le-ble-controller-arduino-compatible) I hope I can make it work. And the mcu is delivered in one
piece and the vendor supports hcb....

**Total Time Taken: 5hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 20hrs*

## 30th May 2025 - Savings, PCB

Were back to $100, I am soo happy again. But it has it's costs. The only reason
I have Typeractive is because I wanted their key switches (red), and no one has
them. But their shipping costs $15 if the total cost is under $75, and since
the switches were themeselves $30 I thought I should add other stuff too, so I
did and got eligible of free delivery. All the I bought would've been bought
eitherwise. Neo Marco had better prices. If I had used Neo Marco I could've
saved like $5-10 but they had the worst switches! And I'd have to find the
other things elsewhere too that I order from Typeractive since Neo Marco
doesn't have all of them! The only problem is that support of hcb. I don't know
if they support it.

*0.5hrs*

I do not think there's a single store left that ships nRF52840 mcu in India.
Almost all of them either do not support hcb or have really expensive shipping.
Finally I have found this https://holykeebs.com/products/supermini-nrf52840 I
hope it is not a scam and supports hcb. The total cost now is $30. ($10 shipping + tax)

*0.5hrs*

Thankfully atleast my PCB is done. Only some holes for mounting are needed.
Other than that, making the cases is left. Then my keyboard will be done!

*3hrs*

We're up for a new problem... PCBs are expensive. And mine is more than 10x10cm
so it costs a hell lot! $11 in jlcpcb and that is the cheapest I saw in all
stores.

My Options:
1. Pitch For more money
2. Make the PCB 10x10cm by removing keys
3. Remove the case.
4. Make a reversible pcb so I can use one PCB for both left and right.

My BOM is already very optimised(?) and I don't think it can get any cheaper.
What I will do is 2, 3 & 4. I will not pitch the idea because I fear I will get
rejected because I have no prior projects to show and making a keyboard is not
that hard. Other people are doing such cool projects. I am jealous. But I will
not fall behind. A caseless wireless split keyboard also has its own coolness.

I will still make the case because that was the one of the criteria, but will
not order it.

So now I will get to work on getting everything on the top layer and making it
reversible.

Now after another very big overhaul to my PCB I am now done with the pcb layout
I think only tracing is left. I will do that tomorrow and be done with it.
Making the case is left. I have done partial work on that. Have to do more.

</p>

And after that I will only have to do the firmware and I will be done with my
SplitWave!

*Total Time Till Now: 27hrs*

## 31th May 2025 - Cases and PCB

I am done with the cases and the pcb(i think). I still need to go through
everything in the pcb so that I can rest assured that my connections are good
and appropriate.

*4hrs*

I think I am once and for all done with the cases! I have made three cases.
Out of these I will print 2 or one of these in sets of 2 (for left and right).
If budget doesn't allow that then I will just do the open_case that is just the
bottom thing. And if I have a little more money left then I will get both the
top and bottom (excluding the open_case this time).

*1hrs*

Done some small tweaks to my pcb. ANd completed my BOM. It is finally complete
now!!! I am really happy. The number says it is $150.2 but I am sure it will be
around $149 because I approximated the last few entries of the BOM. Will update
them before submitting surely with exact amounts.

Now the only thing left is Firmware I already know that I will be using ZMK for
this but I have no prior experience with ZMK. Well we'll make this work out as
well! Lets head over to the docs and give it a nice read

*0.5hrs*

Finished reading ZMK Journal upto [this](https://zmk.dev/docs/customization) also made the [repo](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/zmk-config-splitwave.git) they asked and
following the steps they are saying feeling a lot tired today...I might be a
bit feverish today... good night to me.

**Total Time Taken: 6hrs**

*Total Time Till now: 33hrs*

## 1st June 2025 - Finished!!!

### Yapping
I am making this(probably last) journal entry from my phone because my laptop
just ran out of battery and I forgot to make the journal. We're experiencing
flood so there's no electricity my mobile also has like very less so I will
make it quick, read the submitting guide one last time and then hopefully
submit. I don't know when I will be able to check the results though, last year
electricity was cutt off for a whole week...

### Journalling
So today I just made my firmware using ZMK it was not hard, it compiled without
any warning or errors but I am not sure if it will work yet until I have the
mcu. 

ZMK took a lot of brain. Read the docs a lot. Most of the stuff are ditto same
to their docs only. Other than that I also went through the source code of ZMK
searching for other Shields for reference, other than that I also took some
references from a keyboard named caldera.

The links are as follows:
https://github.com/christianselig/caldera-keyboard

https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/shields/corne

The zmk-config folder is here: 
https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/zmk-config-splitwave/tree/main

And the built firmware is here:
https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/zmk-config-splitwave/actions/runs/15375124402

That is it all! I am really happy I have made the effort in Journalling this
whole journey. I hope I can execute the final building of the keyboard when the
parts arrive!

**Total Time Taken: 4hrs**

*Total Time Till now: 37hrs*

## 2nd June 2025 - Customising
I should've waited before submitting... anyway I just remembered something. I
DID NOT HAVE ANY COOL SILKSCREEN DRAWINGS!! So I hopped back in the kicad and
fixed it. Included HC logos and personal name flexing on the board. Made a smol
change to the top_case so that there is space to see the silkscreens :) also
made things less messed up by adding a git ignore and adding the zmk-config as
a submodule. Also I remembered that I didn't include the PCB-3D view (not that
I think it was mandatory) but here it is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6bdcda3-fc9e-407a-a3c5-6bb332dbc9ab" alt="front pcb image" width="300"/><br>
      <b>Front Of the PCB</b>

      <b>Updated PCB</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

And now I (think I) can say that my SplitWave is done!

### Yapping
Fortunately it was a mini flood and water went down completety by today
morning. Electricity came yesterday at 12:30 at night ig.

*2hrs*

### Back to Journalling
haah.... I am back again... Now again I made some small changes to the silkscreens and am working on the README.md at the same time.
The Images of the Silkscreen closer up:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

      <b>Back Silkscreen</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I am done with the README and there's nothing more I think that I need to do now.
I hope this time finally the SplitWave is done.

Just got to know that I will have to journal the making process too irl! I mean
I take that as a win for me!!! I really liked journalling this entire project
till now!!! So that just means I'll be here for more time :)

**Total Time Taken: 3Hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 40hrs*

## 3nd June 2025 - Customising
Yesterday I read about the ["Shipping"](https://highway.hackclub.com/advanced/shipping) requirement, I think I am preety much 
there but these are the things I will do first:

- Change the file structure to have the pcb and cases in the root.
- Create a printables account and upload my 3d files there. and add them in the readme

Also changed the 3d Cases a little. The cases had some measurement problems that
have been solved. It would've been devastating if those stayed in the case. 
Thank god I found them and fixed them. The updated cases are as follows:

*Total Time Till Now: 41hrs*

No real work done, just a update. YOU KNOW WHAT!!!! MY PROJECT JUST GOT
APPROVED!!! I'LL RECEIVE THE GRANT BY TODAY (4th June) SO I'LL GO IN A SHOPPING
SPREE TOMORROW!!!! I AM SOO EXCITED!!!!

## 5nd June 2025 - Shopping Real this time

I just bought my stuff from Typeractive.xyz all of them costed $76.92 almost
half a dollar less than calculated ($77.34), inflation in India I think.
Also bought the supermini-nrf52840 from holykeebs. They are trusted site I saw
in many reviews.
Next I was going to buy the batteries....but I think makerbazar.in is not
trustable. I went through some reviews and didn't find them to be good with
quality and delivery. Customer support also seemed bad, I think I will have to
search for batteries again. It must be the 4th time something like this has
happened to me with battery buying. It also means I will have to change my case
according to the battery size....

Took me a whole day but I finally found a good vendor. And I ordered it. Quite
the same price for 480mah where they sold 2200mah for this price. I think that
previously it was indeed scam. But there's a problem. There was some technical
dificulties and in their website it still shows payment pending. I have raised
a ticket. Hopefully they reply soon.

Apart from that I also ordered the pcb. For that I had to fix some violations
that I ignored earlier in my pcb design. Now they are fixed. The payment went
smoothly and my pcb is approved already.

*3hrs*

Yay!! They have confirmed my order!! I knew they were good people!

Also got to know that I am not supposed to order the cases. So I am extra happy
that I can now just save $8 for myself. Lemme see if I need something else. Aah
yes a screw driver, if I have enough money... and they are cheap like not more
than $2

I am done with my updated case. It looks absolutely the same. Just changed some
heights for the new smaller battery.
I will now just buy the screws and battery jack. But not that fast. I will wait
till tomorrow. just cause

hah... couldn't wait. Also bought the jack. Only thing left is screws. I am
having internet problems rn so I will tackle that tomorrow.

**Total Time Taken 4hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 45hrs*

## 6th June 2025

I am soo soooooo dumb. There has to be two bottom cases. Right and left!! I
can't just turn the bottom case over and call it a day 😭😭😭

Done with the cases. Also tried to buy the screws.... I can't IG they don't
support international cards.

**Negligible Time**

## 10th June 2025

I've made some small changes over the days that I didn't journal like adding
another 2mm to my case height to accomodate the switch height.

Taking pictures for it. Updating stuff. Keeping track of items that I ordered.

I have made plans to add homerow mods to my keyboard! Now it will be even more
cool with timeless modkey

**Negligible Time**

## 15th June 2025 - Giving up

A lot has had happened. I was really lost. I felt really guilty. I still do.
Because I fucked up. I had assumed that I will be lucky with them but I was
proven wrong because of the JLCPCB having a tax of about $18 on $17 order. I
was heartbroken thinking all my hardwork was for nothing I cried a little. I
talked with Hackclub people and told them that I will be dropping out of the
event because I will not be able to pay my taxes. They are a lot. 

But the are so kind that they said they will pay my taxes. Even though the do
not do it. They said that they will make it a exception because they liked the
love and effort I put in Splitwave. I still do not know how much customs in the
$75 order but I still hope for the best.

Right now I am finishing up my cases. I am making the USB-C port hole and the
buttons holes too.

Other than that I also have recieved the Jacks & batteries. The JLCPCB should
also come quiet fast now.

**Total Time Taken 0.5hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 45.5hrs*

## 21st June 2025 - Battery Holder

Today I plan modify my case again to make holder for battery :) 

I am done with fully updating my cases took a while, had fun! Will take images now.

Things I did:

- Add Battery Holder
- Re-did the art in the bottom because earlier it was 0.5mm and someone
  adviced me to have multiple of 0.2 because that is what most 3D printers
  support.

Also did I mention almost all my stuff came! Only things left are Typeractive
stuff and Microcontrollers. The things that Splitwave heavily depends upon!

I just pray for less customs!

I love staring at the PCBs they are SOOOO COOOOOOLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## 27th June 2025 - Magazine

Today when I got up I got a notification that we have to submit the Magazine
page by 29th of this month!! The time is very less and I really wanted to get
my magazine page. So I am gonna do it. Starting with taking good pictures of my
keyboard.... I really never made the full 3D-model of my keyboard. I mean yes I
have the case but not all the things together.

So I spent like 2hrs making my keyboard. Scavanging the internet for the parts.
Placing every part. Then.... I didn't like what I had come up with. Not the
design. I didn't like the colour combination. It really looked shit. I thought
that if needed I will change the key-caps colour manually when they come.
Hopefully acrylic colours work. I will paint the black keycaps to full white.

Anyway tried a lot of colour combinations. For all the cases. And I think I
will settle down with the black colours because it'll look cool. But for my
magazine page I will use brigth colours because that will loog good there.

Anyway all this today took like 3hrs of my time or more I think I sat down at
9am after taking breakfast now it's 1pm

Been making my Magazine page for a while. Now it's 3pm and I am not done yet!

Just now(6pm) I checked and my typeractive parts have arrived very close to me.
I am sooo osooo fucking happy!!! It was suck for like 5 days. Should reach me
by a week at the very longest! I am afraid of the taxes.

Another hour put into the magazine. Almost done I'd say.

## 28th June 2025 - 3D printing

I asked for @Arnav in slack for making my prints. He accepted but seems to be
busy atm. It's okay I can do continue. I am happy he accepted to make mine :)

Also I am almost done with the Magazine probably will send it today. Thanks to
the suggestions of @Varun G, @rowyn and @acon!

They are making an Poster. Everyone it putting their signatures and pictures in
that and I snucked mine in a cozy place. But I didn't my poor lappy crashed
multiple times during this. But by the end I managed to do it.

After some time it seems that someone has moved my signature. Need find criminal.

## 30th June 2025 - Investigation

The package reached my city. But they seemed to have sent it to some other post
office by mistake. I went to the city's head post office while returning from
my school. The said it will reach the Nearmost post office to my village
tomorrow and will reach me by day-after-tomorrow at the latest. I was
accompanied by @Shibam Roy to my visit to post office.

I have a backlog of images to add to my journal. Will do them today rn.

I was a little disheartened to know that Arnav started printing the ones that
were added after mine. But later I got to know that he is doint multiple same
colour print at the same time to save time. He's a cool guy. Sorry for getting
you wrong 🙏!

Also I might've forgotten to mention but my mcu has also been dispatched to
Guwahati! It will reach my state from there and it'll be really fast(I think)

Today The Typeractive stuff arrived. The PO guy called me and said he will
deliver it today and hung up. I called him again in anticipation asking him how
much money I need to pay. He said I won't need to pay anything!!!

I was soo happy I could explode!!

The stuff arrived at like 5pm, couldn't take a good look into it because I had
to go to tutions. When I came back I assembled it (ofc without any solder,
because my kit hasn't arrived yet)

IT LOOKS GREAT!! AND THE SWITCHES SOUND SOOOOO DAMN GREAT!!!! I WAS SOO HAPPY I
EXPLODED TODAY.

## 06th July 2025 - Lucky!

Today I was revisiting the zmk docs thinking I might find something cool that
I'd want to add to my keyboard! Well I didn't find something really cool but
something that I might need later on -> USB support! Commenting out that for
now since I have no use of it rn.

Anyway while I was at it, I FOUND A SERIOUS PROBLEM!!! In my ZMK config repo,
inside Kconfig.defconfig file I had the checks for `SHIELD_MY_KEYBOARD_LEFT`
instead of `SHIELD_SPLITWAVE_LEFT`!! Now it all makes sense!!! Why both the
keyboard firmware files had the same size! I hope I haven't left anything like
this anywhere in my repo! That'd be a nightmare to find out!

The commit is [here](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/zmk-config-splitwave/commit/0d09642213413f79d951a8247fc74aa19b9c590b#r161541550)

This also means none of my previous firmwares will work at all!! this stuff is
scary! Just to be safe I am reviewing every single file of the zmk-config
repo!!

And Bam! Not even 10mins I found another problem! I forgot to change the names
of my keyboard!!

## 12th July 2025 - HeartAttack!!

This is a big yap see below for tldr;

My Microcontrollers have been sitting in my local post office for the past 5
days. I didn't contact them for all this time because they usually take 3 days
to deliver. Today I called them asking about the status of my package and when
it will reach me.

> "Hello, am I speaking to < address > Post Office?"
> 
> "Yes"
> 
> "I wanted to know when my package will come to me"
> 
> "Okay I will check it for you, please send the tracking link to me in this number"
> 
> "Okay"

I sent.. and 10mins passed. I called again.

> "Hello, I was asking if everything is alr? I called a while back. I am Ankush."
> 
> "Hello, we have a problem... The package has been sent to <City's 2nd Biggest
> Post Office>, because the package didn't have any mobile number to contact you.
> If the package has been dispatched from there you will never be able to get it
> anymore."
> 
> "Huh...? WHAT? There's nothing I can do?"
> 
> "Unfortunately no, we just yesterday sent it. Only if you had called a day
> earlier. We can just hope that they haven't dispatched it to return to the
> sender."
> 
> "okay..."

I was dejected as anything.

I waited scratching my head and reconsidering my life choices..... thinking if
it is karma.

They called after like an hour.

> "Hello, we have good news! The package hasn't been dispatched yet. I called
> them and should arrive here after 5-10mins. You can come here and recieve it at
> any time now"

I talked to them some stuff and hung up. I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooo happy
I couldn't express it. I took my cycle and cycled 4km in 15mins! I never cycle
this fast. Not in the busy streets of India.

'Also forgot to mention I almost got under a truck 💀'

I reached there and got my package with a big smile, thanked them. Had a
wonderful conversation with them and left!

The fact that my package could've been unable to reach me anymore if I had
called them an hour late haunts me

Came home. Unboxed it. It was FUCKING WET! Might've been soaked in the recent
flood :heavysob: anyway fortunately the microcontrollers were insidea another
plastic bag(?). I opened them. This is my first time seeing an MCU in person.
It's small as hell. Cool as Hell. Amazing as HELL! 

Next I needed someway to flash it. For it I need to get it to the bootloader
mode. I have to short-circuit the rst and gnd pins. But I do not have any
jumper wires. So... I cut my mother's old laundry wire. Which she made by using
old wires. And used them to do the deed. It worked! I connected it to my mobile
and bam! Nope nothing to "bam" here. It was just that. But it was soo cool
experience!!

I now just have to wait for my soldering kit. Then I can start soldering and
completing my keyboard!

Also did I mention? NO CUSTOMS HERE TOO!!!

#### tldr;

My pkg was about to be returned to the sender. I got saved by a small margin.
It arrived (NO CUSTOMS!!). I flashed my .utf file. It worked :) I happi

## 16th July 2025 - Fun Yet Again!!!

Today after like 20 days my Amazon soldering kit arrived! I was soo happy! It
works good, and included everything it promised except the sponge. But I was
gravely disappointed by the quantity of stuff like soldering wire, wick and
flux. Don't know if they'll last the even left half of the keyboard. Searching
for flux-core soldering wire (50gm) in Indian stores.

Got some good deals but dunno about it yet. Will consult slack people for
wisdom.

Also to try the iron. I soldered my broken earphone. It didn't take much solder
or flux. But works like new now. Doesn't look new tho. I did do a bad job at
soldering I'd say.

No time was spent towards actual development so not adding time. Still all the
exploring took like less than an hour. But I was so mesmerised with it. I spent
like 3hrs messing with all the stuff that arrived.

I am free on friday. Will start soldering my left half then. Also I will get an
idea about how much solder I will need.

## 17th July 2025 - Working IRL

Today I soldered 3 switched completely on one of my 5 pcbs, the one which was
in the worst shape. It worked great! I am really proud of how well it turned
out! Later I also tried bridging the jumper pads of my PCB. It worked great but
I think I can do better. 

I leant two things today.

1. My soldering wire is rosin core.
2. Flux is not water soluble (Someone in the intrenet said I can remove it with water 😭😭)

## 18th July 2025 - Working IRL

So after a lot of things. A LOT OF PLANNING. A lot of RESEARCH. AND AFTER A LOT
OF SHIT. Almost after 2 months. I started to work on my keeb.

Today at 11PM I set out to solder all my diodes to the left half. I was really
excited to work on it. But this time it was not going as good as it did
yesterday. IDK why.

I somehow managed to solder all the 22 diodes in my left half. Not a lot of
solder was wasted. I also checked all the diode's current flow thingy with my
multimeter. And all of them were correct.

Today too I leant two things:

1. Soldering wick get crazy hot. Don't touch them (I burnt my hand a lil)
2. Flux is not useless.

## 19th July 2025 - Finally ACTUALLY working on the Keeb!!!!

I today Soldered the jumper pads of my pcb. Soldered the MCU. Tested it. It
seems to work. I mean I see blue and red lights :)

Next I soldered some of the hotswap sockets. And tried if the keys are working.
THEY WERE WORKING. But I have some software problems!

1. Seems like having Colemak_mod_dh layout is not a good idea. My OS itself
   converts the normal keystrokes to Colemak_mod_dh from qwerty once. So doing
   it is not good. Also this way others can use my keyboard!
2. The 1st and 3rd rows are swapped. Easy fix.
3. The outer-pinky and pinky columns were also swapped. Easier fix. 

Now I plan to solder all the other parts like reset/power/jst jack. And then I
will solder all the othre hotswap sockets. If they suffice. I don't have my
hopes up. There is not a lot left. I will continue this at night after dinner.

Now I am done with the left half completely. And I have some solder left too!
But I pretty much messed up my power slider. I mistakenly joined two of the
pins. And it was HARD TO REMOVE THE BRIDGE!!! I finally did it. I am so happy I
was able to do it, I was about to cry 😭

Now it's done and I am just waiting on more solder/case/screws.

## 20th July 2025 - Stress & Pain

I had a problem yesterday that was seemed too easy to fix, so much so that I
didn't even mention it in my last journal - My thumb cluster (the bottom most
row of my keybarod) is not working/ has never worked ever. I just thought that
it'd be a easy fix. You are gonna read how easy it was.

Today morning I set up to see why the bottom row isn't working. I checked
connections. Connections good. I checked ZMK docs. I matched the gpio pins with
the schematic of my MCU. I matched the PCB. All of them were correct. Lastly I
confirmed my problem to be a dead pin on my MCU.

I requested for help in many discord. Searched google. Read ZMK docs.
Nobody/nothing helped. Lastly I someone from Hackclub messaged me in Slack
saying my GPIO pin probably isn't working and is acting as ground. I somehow
have to manage to re-route (using jumper wires) the trace and isolate it from
the previous pin and use another spare pin. I was shocked. I do not have any
jumper wires. And that meant I have to dig into the PCB. Break open the copper
layer. Split and solder the wire.

I asked my friend for jumper wires. He said he has very few but will lend me
one. I have to wait till Monday to get from him.

Then I remembered. I ordered JST cables from sunrom. And the minimum was like
10. SO BY DEFAULT I HAVE 20 JUMPER WIRES!! I broke open one wire and got to 
working. I first tested my concept on a spare pcb (the same one where I
soldered my first 3 diodes)

It worked flawlessly in my spare pcb. But when I got to do the main one it
wasn't working. I get to clumsy. Took a deep breath and did it correctly the
next time and it worked.

I soldered the wire to the pcb and handwire the other end to the MCU  and
tried. It didn't work. I thought it was because of connectivity issue. So I
soldered it. It didn't work either.

I spent a lot of time figuring out what was wrong. I finally did. Fixed it. And
it was working!!

I cannot stretch enough how stressful today was! I again thought my whole
project was going downfall again. But now I have a big smile writing today's
whole journal with my left keyboard and right laptop keys :)

## 24th July 2025 - Casify

So, my case is really cool! But it has a problem, it suffers from correctness.
Yes exactly! My case is too perfect. And in 3D-Printing world that is called
skill issue. My pcb doesn't fit that good without some troubles. And getting it
out is another hurdel.

So since I had to tolerances I just planned to sand it down. Then I remember
that I have a rotatory tool. Why not use that? I got the rotatory tool out.
Made my setup and vrrooom, good as new. But I had no real experience working
with it. And it's hard to make something good with rotatory tool. All my last
attempts were near death experiences. Sooo.... yeah. 

But I didn't give in. I pushed through and tried to sand one spare (The one in
a very bad shape) case. AND IT DIDN"T WORK OUT!! It clogged in a place and I
made it worse than what it originally was.

So... about the "messed" up case. I didn't do it. It came like this. I guess
that is why Arnav sent 2 of the same (left) case.

So I planned on hand-sanding it. And that is what I did. I cut two sand roll in
my rotatory tool and got it over with. My hands hurt and I am droppin off.

It fits good now. Could've done a better job if I had the good sand-paper but
I'll take it.

Also now I am done with the title of my new magazine. Followed the tutorial at https://anchor.hackclub.com

## 25th July 2025 - Left Build Complete

So today my screws arrived and I did what I was supposed to do, heat the
threaded inserts and shove them inside the holes made for them. I failed to do
all of them. Not a single one worked as expected. I am a failure 😭. I somehow
managed to screw it up. I don't think I'd need the screws anyway, since the
case was so tight. I had to put a lot of force to get the pcb inside the case
in the first place. And I tried to pry open the PCB to check some stuff. It was
a hard job to do it.

Also since I do not want to open the case once I've committed to it, I have
attatched the battery now! I was freaking out at first! I wasn't working, but
after a long time I found out that I forgot to turn on the slider switch xD

really too soft. But I was unable to understand what was going wrong. Thanks to
Acon for the suggestion. I will redo the magazine again now.

I worked for some time and made something that might do the work I mixed 3

## 30th July 2025 - Cooked really badly.

I woke up and booted into my laptop. Something seems wrong. My password isnt'
working. wait. I can't type. How can this happen!??!? I just worked using it
yesterday!! Oh no. It doesn't work at all ;( Fortunately splitwave works but
only the left half.

I brought out my last external keeb. It works for like 10s and then doesn't
work anymore for the next few minutes. I plugged it in. I typed my pswd. 

It went out (keeb).

I tried again after some time. This time I opened a terminal and installed an
application called "onboard" well well well that name rings a bell xd. I
researched about onboard during the keeb was out.

Okay the keeb went out again but this time I had onboard. I worked with it. And
it was okayish ig never comparable to my keeb but works ig.

I need to finish keyboard really badly now. I can't live like this. I will do
it today after tutions and school.

Okay sooo. Life is not going my way at all!! I was done soldering all the parts
of my keeb rn! All the diodes and hotswaps! The new solder is a bit tricky to
work with. It came in yesterday. It is a bit thicker and needs a little bit
more temp than normal to melt. I somehow made it work. Soldered it all.
attatched the keeys to the pcb trying to see if it works or not in my lappy.
Well... it did work. But my soldering iron didn't. It was not like heating
less. It was not heating at all!! My work will be over here. I can't use the
soldering iron for my heat inserts. Fortunately only heated inerts were left.
And since my case was so tight I don't think it will fly off if I do not use
the screws 💀. Anyway I will try to fix it anyhow tomorrow because I messed up
with one of my diodes. I made one opposite orientation. And one of the solder
joints was dry and came off. I have to do that too. So I will have to fix my
soldering iron anyhow.

## 31th July 2025 - Fix the iron!

Okay. I set up to fix my iron today. Watched a tutorial of what can go wrong
and what to check for fixing. Using my multimeter I quickly found out that one
of the wires burnt off so I was unable to use it. Since I have unlimited supply
of jumper wires I stripped one off and used it's conductor as replacement of
the old wire. It worked. But stopped working again. I did it again. Hot
Glue-gunned it down (because I didn't have iron to solder the joint) and then
it worked! I fixed my iron. Fixed yesterday's issuse. Put the inserts. Tightned
the screws. And my left half was done. 

Okay my build is complete now, I should put out the demo rn. I won't get
anything but I want to tick all the boxes that highway offers so I will do it
anyway :3

Okay, now it's just skill issue. I procastinated it a lot. Worked on the
magazine a little and added some cool lightnings. Nothing much. I have already
missed the deadline, why does it even matter now.

I am doing it now just because it is really fun.

Tbh I think it came out pretty good ngl.

**Total Time Taken: 1hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 80hrs*

## 5th August 2025 - Magazine 😭

I think I am done. Added a lot of stupid and randome stuff that made it look
cool. Not the best page surely, but the most worked one page surely!! I think
that this is really cool and I love it.

I just hoped that I finished it before the deadline (31st July).

## 6th August 2025 - Magazine 😭😭😭😭😭😭

Okay, I got great news my page is up!! They extended the deadline and I never
knew 😭, I was unable to add my page in the magazine figma file because of some
stupid authenticatin, but someone else did it for me :)

## 11th August 2025 - Journalling

Okay, I had been really busy the past two weeks, I made the journalling of all
the dates since 25th July. Will add the images a little later.

Now that all this has come to an end. I will like to say that the past two
months had been really momorable for me. The ups and downs. The struggle. The
emotions. The hardwork.

It was all worth it. It was all more than just an experience. It is something I
will never forget. I think that journalling was something I really liked too. I
think I will take this habit to my next projects on the way. I like doing it.
Helps keep track of my progress and a fun thing I can look back upon.

Also today is Acon's bday and I have to wish her!! I can't procastinate this
out of today.

In this event. I leant more than just hardware. I learnt tax, designing, fixing
stuff growing with community. In this event I talked the most with the people
too getting out there taking help, helping others and having fun with everyone.

All of the journal (since 25th July) made with 🩷 using SplitWave.

*Total Time Till Now: A lot, looking back...not so much*
