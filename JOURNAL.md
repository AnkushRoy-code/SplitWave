# Total Time: 40Hrs

## 25th May 2025 - Research

I went on over many videos on how to make a keyboard. One such video that I
will be taking inspiration from is [this](https://youtu.be/7UXsD7nSfDY?si=TfY8_UKlWWHZYKqw).

I tried to make a list of things I will need and their price, I also looked at
different options for the items I will use, for example I desperately read
stuff about Pro Micro because that is cheaper than n!n but I came to conclusion
that Pro Micro will be a little hard for what I am lookign to achieve, I still
may change my opinion later down the line. Most of the prices are from
[Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz).
Another website I found good is [Meckeys](https://meckeys.com).

I looked at different types of switch options I have and its hard to decide
now. I will take my time now. The price on the rough BOM rn is the one present
in Typeractive. If I don't find anything cheaper or really worth it I won't
change it. I also looked at the keycaps for a long time but I think I won't
need anything other than what Typeractive offers.

I have not started any real work now.

But I do have the starting foundation layed out.
I now have a clear vision in mind now for what to do next. (Board design using
ErgoGen ig)

The rough BOM: https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/StuffNeeded.md

#### Rough Sketch
10:00PM I drew a rough sketch of how it should look like... the alignment and
staggerdness is not what I want. It is just a place holder also it will be
Colemak_mod_dh layout instead of qwerty. I just had a keyboard with qwerty keys
infornt of me so I used that as a reference.

| Color          | Layer           |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Red            | Default         |
| Green          | Number          |
| Black          | Function        |

All the keys are subjected to change

Here's a picture of what it should look like (again not the final thing. Only the structure)

**Total Time Taken: 5hrs**

The sketch took ~2hrs, took a lot of planning!

## 26th May 2025 - More Research On ErgoGen

**Evening**
Watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tERUZ_BSPM) 20min video by the creator of Ergogen.
Read the entire [docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz/) of Ergogen.
I will not bore anyone with the things I learnt here. Also there was a lot to
digest so I might've forgotten a lot of stuff by the end...ðŸ˜¢

**Night**
Another [tutorial](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-part1-units-points/) mentioned in the docs seemed really helpful to me. During my
journey I'll I will use it too!

**Total Time Taken: 2hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 7hrs*

## 27th May 2025 - Getting the Keyboard to life

Sat down and wrote the config for my keyboard, it is taking shape now. But
there is a lot that I have to change and tiker.

Took longer than I thought, the flatfootfox tutorial is very good! I learnt the
same things better I'd say. I decided to let go of the 5th key in the thumb
cluster. I only have 4 keys now. I am done with the structure that I seem fit
for my usecase.

Up until now it approx took **1.5hrs** in total.

Now I am done with the outline too! Took **1hrs** at the very least.

<p align="center">

  <b>An image of the keyboard with outline generated by ErgoGen</b>
</p>

The config.yaml can be found [here](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/SplitWave/blob/main/ergogen/config.yaml).

Did even more study on mcu(s) to use. Asked some pros in ergogen discord and
they answered immideatly.
The things I am considering now:
- Not nice!nano anymore `$25`
- Seeed XIAO nRF52840 `$10.5`
- SuperMini nRF52840 `$9.5`

I have read about a lot on the mcus I decided that I will be using Seeed XIAO
because of the pros suggestion and SuperMini being russian roullete. That is a
saving of a whooping $25!!

The only problem is that I there's not much resources as n!n in the web. But I
will make it work out!

Apart from that I also read the ZMK docs, the Seeed XIAO nRF52840 docs and the
next day my target will be completing the research of the mcu and be done with
the pcb

**Total Time Taken: 5hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 12hrs*

## 28th May 2025 - Shopping

Searched other Indian stores a lot, a frind suggested me this reddit [wiki](www.reddit.com/r/mkindia/wiki/vendors/)
that had good Indian vendors. I found NeoMarco to be my choice of vendor. Had
all the stuff I needed, all of them cheaper than typeractive, has free
shipping, is trusted too!

But I had some compatibility confusions so I dropped them an email. I hope they answer soon.

And the downsides now. I planned to have 3 things from typeractive
- Switches
- Keycaps
- Hot Swap

and all these 3 had great quality and were to my liking. But in NeoMarco the
problems are:

- Switches: Only Yellow is in stock. I wanted Red (The colours matter for
typing experience if you didn't know. Each colour has different feel to them).
But I am ready to compromise
- Keycaps: Only Transparent is available. I don't mind it that much. I think
trans is cool!
- Hot Swap: Looks weird. Had compatibility doubts so I dropped an email.

Overall I think all the stores are great. Just that they can't do everything
for everyone. typeractive would've been my go-to if I were in the west.

*This took like a little more than an hour*

Spent a lot of time searching for batteries. Took a long time but finally found
it! In quartzcomponents' website.

Also I am half done with my pcb!

**Total Time Taken: 3hrs**

*Total Time Till Now: 15hrs*

## 29th May 2025 - BOM.csv, MCU selection

Today my plans are of making the BOM in a csv file with links. Since it's
getting hard to manage everything rn.

The Bom is done hardly took 30mins.

New problem! QuartzComponents doesn't support hcb ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I will have to again
search for batterise.

Found some batteries [here](https://makerbazar.in/products/3-7v-2200mah-li-po-rechargeable-battery) no I idea if it supports hcb but I will have it
here just for backup.

A very bad news. The footprint I was using for seeed_xiao was for seeed xiao.
Not seeed xiao plus. But the bigger problem is the battery connection. It is a
mess in xiao.

Unfortunately because of the battery problem I have to drop XIAO. I will be
using Nice!Nano.

I am really sad....I have made good progress towards making the pcb, but the
price is concerning. I have to do something about it. I know it. I will just
not use Nice!Nano. I will just use the off-brand mcus. Even though they are
really sketchy. I will have to trust them. Or else I will be wasting a lot of
money because I was scared of Seeed XIAO, the one I am looking at right now is
this: [supermini](https://robokits.co.in/iot-wireless-solutions/iot-internet-of-things/iot-esp-module/supermini-nrf52840-pro-micro-bluetooth-le-ble-controller-arduino-compatible) I hope I can make it work. And the mcu is delivered in one
piece and the vendor supports hcb....

*Total Time Till Now: 20hrs*

## 30th May 2025 - Savings, PCB

Were back to $100, I am soo happy again. But it has it's costs. The only reason
I have Typeractive is because I wanted their key switches (red), and no one has
them. But their shipping costs $15 if the total cost is under $75, and since
the switches were themeselves $30 I thought I should add other stuff too, so I
did and got eligible of free delivery. All the I bought would've been bought
eitherwise. Neo Marco had better prices. If I had used Neo Marco I could've
saved like $5-10 but they had the worst switches! And I'd have to find the
other things elsewhere too that I order from Typeractive since Neo Marco
doesn't have all of them! The only problem is that support of hcb. I don't know
if they support it.

*0.5hrs*

I do not think there's a single store left that ships nRF52840 mcu in India.
Almost all of them either do not support hcb or have really expensive shipping.
Finally I have found this https://holykeebs.com/products/supermini-nrf52840 I
hope it is not a scam and supports hcb. The total cost now is $30. ($10 shipping + tax)

*0.5hrs*

Thankfully atleast my PCB is done. Only some holes for mounting are needed.
Other than that, making the cases is left. Then my keyboard will be done!

We're up for a new problem... PCBs are expensive. And mine is more than 10x10cm
so it costs a hell lot! $11 in jlcpcb and that is the cheapest I saw in all
stores.

My Options:
1. Pitch For more money
2. Make the PCB 10x10cm by removing keys
3. Remove the case.
4. Make a reversible pcb so I can use one PCB for both left and right.

My BOM is already very optimised(?) and I don't think it can get any cheaper.
What I will do is 2, 3 & 4. I will not pitch the idea because I fear I will get
rejected because I have no prior projects to show and making a keyboard is not
that hard. Other people are doing such cool projects. I am jealous. But I will
not fall behind. A caseless wireless split keyboard also has its own coolness.

I will still make the case because that was the one of the criteria, but will
not order it.

So now I will get to work on getting everything on the top layer and making it
reversible.

Now after another very big overhaul to my PCB I am now done with the pcb layout
I think only tracing is left. I will do that tomorrow and be done with it.
Making the case is left. I have done partial work on that. Have to do more.

</p>

And after that I will only have to do the firmware and I will be done with my
SplitWave!

## 31th May 2025 - Cases and PCB

I am done with the cases and the pcb(i think). I still need to go through
everything in the pcb so that I can rest assured that my connections are good
and appropriate.

*4hrs*

I think I am once and for all done with the cases! I have made three cases.
Out of these I will print 2 or one of these in sets of 2 (for left and right).
If budget doesn't allow that then I will just do the open_case that is just the
bottom thing. And if I have a little more money left then I will get both the
top and bottom (excluding the open_case this time).

*1hrs*

Done some small tweaks to my pcb. ANd completed my BOM. It is finally complete
now!!! I am really happy. The number says it is $150.2 but I am sure it will be
around $149 because I approximated the last few entries of the BOM. Will update
them before submitting surely with exact amounts.

Now the only thing left is Firmware I already know that I will be using ZMK for
this but I have no prior experience with ZMK. Well we'll make this work out as
well! Lets head over to the docs and give it a nice read

*0.5hrs*

Finished reading ZMK Journal upto [this](https://zmk.dev/docs/customization) also made the [repo](https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/zmk-config-splitwave.git) they asked and
following the steps they are saying feeling a lot tired today...I might be a
bit feverish today... good night to me.

**Total Time Taken: 6hrs**

*Total Time Till now: 33hrs*

## 1st June 2025 - Finished!!!

### Yapping
I am making this(probably last) journal entry from my phone because my laptop
just ran out of battery and I forgot to make the journal. We're experiencing
flood so there's no electricity my mobile also has like very less so I will
make it quick, read the submitting guide one last time and then hopefully
submit. I don't know when I will be able to check the results though, last year
electricity was cutt off for a whole week...

### Journalling
So today I just made my firmware using ZMK it was not hard, it compiled without
any warning or errors but I am not sure if it will work yet until I have the
mcu. 

ZMK took a lot of brain. Read the docs a lot. Most of the stuff are ditto same
to their docs only. Other than that I also went through the source code of ZMK
searching for other Shields for reference, other than that I also took some
references from a keyboard named caldera.

The links are as follows:
https://github.com/christianselig/caldera-keyboard

https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/app/boards/shields/corne

The zmk-config folder is here: 
https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/zmk-config-splitwave/tree/main

And the built firmware is here:
https://github.com/AnkushRoy-code/zmk-config-splitwave/actions/runs/15375124402

That is it all! I am really happy I have made the effort in Journalling this
whole journey. I hope I can execute the final building of the keyboard when the
parts arrive!

**Total Time Taken: 4hrs**

*Total Time Till now: 37hrs*

## 2nd June 2025 - Customising
I should've waited before submitting... anyway I just remembered something. I
DID NOT HAVE ANY COOL SILKSCREEN DRAWINGS!! So I hopped back in the kicad and
fixed it. Included HC logos and personal name flexing on the board. Made a smol
change to the top_case so that there is space to see the silkscreens :) also
made things less messed up by adding a git ignore and adding the zmk-config as
a submodule. Also I remembered that I didn't include the PCB-3D view (not that
I think it was mandatory) but here it is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6bdcda3-fc9e-407a-a3c5-6bb332dbc9ab" alt="left pcb image" width="300"/><br>
      <b>Front Of the PCB</b>
    </td>
    <td align="center">

      <b>Back Of the PCB</b>
    </td>
    <td align="center">

      <b>Updated PCB</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

And now I (think I) can say that my SplitWave is done!

### Yapping
Fortunately it was a mini flood and water went down completety by today
morning. Electricity came yesterday at 12:30 at night ig.

*2hrs*

### Back to Journalling
haah.... I am back again... Now again I made some small changes to the silkscreens and am working on the README.md at the same time.
The Images of the Silkscreen closer up:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">

      <b>Back Silkscreen</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I am done with the README and there's nothing more I think that I need to do now.
I hope this time finally the SplitWave is done.

Just got to know that I will have to journal the making process too irl! I mean I take that as a win for me!!! I really liked journalling this entire project till now!!! So that just means I'll be here for more time :)
